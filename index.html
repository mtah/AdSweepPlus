<h1><img src="/AdSweepPlus/images/logo.png" alt="AdSweep+" /></h1>
<p>AdSweep+ is a continuation of the <a href="http://adsweep.org">AdSweep</a> ad-removal utility for Chromium-based browsers (e.g. Google Chrome) as well as Opera, Safari and Firefox<sup><a href="#firefox-note">*</a></sup> and other Greasmonkey-capable browsers.</p>

<h2>Get it</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Chromium-based browsers: Download and install the <a href="http://github.com/mtah/AdSweepPlus/raw/master/AdSweepPlus.crx">Chromium extension</a>.</li>
  <li><p>Other browsers: Theoretically, any browser capable of running Greasemonkey user scripts is capable of running AdSweep+:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Opera: built-in support</li>
      <li>Safari: <a href="http://8-p.info/greasekit/">GreaseKit</a></li>
      <li>Firefox: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748">GreaseMonkey extension</a>
    </ul>
    <p>Download <a href="http://github.com/mtah/AdSweepPlus/raw/master/AdSweepPlus.js">AdSweepPlus.js</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: This section is incomplete. For now, refer to the documentation of each user scripting client and the original <a href="http://adsweep.org">AdSweep</a> site for detailed installation instructions.</em></p>

<h2>Contribute</h2>
<p>I'm picking this project up with the intention of having other people contribute to it as well (ad rules, bug fixes, you name it!). If you want to (and please do), the preferred way is to <a href="http://github.com/mtah/AdSweepPlus">fork the project</a> on GitHub, make your changes and send me a pull request.</p>

<h2>TODO</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Separate ad rules from main source.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="firefox-note"><sup>*</sup>I'm on Firefox, should I use this?</h2>
<p>Firefox already has a very popular native ad-removal extension called <a href="http://adblockplus.org">AdBlock+</a>. Thus, while that extension is in active development, no active effort will be put into testing AdSweep+ with Firefox. You are recommended to use AdBlock+ instead.</p>
